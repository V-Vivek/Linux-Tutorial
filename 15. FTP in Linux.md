- To send multiple files
```bash
ftp 192.168.0.0
Enter username & password
mput file1 file2
```

- We can aslo create directory, cd, etc. in server from client side itself
```
ftp 192.168.0.0
Enter username & password
mkdir myfolder
cd myfolder/
```

## Download file from server using client machine
```bash
ftp 192.168.0.0
Enter username & password
cd server_directory_name
get server_filename
```
