# SED command

## Substitution (s)
- Replace occurrences of a specific pattern with a specified replacement text.
```bash
sed 's/pattern/replacement/' filename
```
- This command replaces the first occurrence of "apple" with "orange" in the file "file.txt".
```bash
sed 's/apple/orange/' file.txt
```

## Delete (d)
- Delete lines based on a given condition or pattern.
- This command deletes all lines containing the specified pattern in the file "file.txt".
```bash
sed '/pattern/d' file.txt
```

## Insert (i)
- Insert text before a specified line or pattern.
- This command inserts the text "New line" before each line containing the specified pattern in the file "file.txt".
```bash
sed '/pattern/i\New line' file.txt
```

Append (a)
- Append text after a specified line or pattern.
- This command appends the text "New line" after each line containing the specified pattern in the file "file.txt".
```bash
sed '/pattern/a\New line' file.txt
```

## Print (p)
- Print lines that match a given condition or pattern.
- This command prints only the lines containing the specified pattern in the file "file.txt".
- The -n option in the sed command is used to suppress automatic printing of lines.

```bash
sed -n '/pattern/p' file.txt
```
