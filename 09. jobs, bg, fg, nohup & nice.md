## jobs
- The jobs command is used to display the status of background jobs in the current shell session. 
- It lists all the running or stopped background jobs along with their job IDs. 
- The jobs command is specific to job control in Unix-like operating systems.

## bg
- The bg command is used to send a stopped background job to run in the background. 
- It takes a job ID or job specification as an argument. 
- For example, ```bg %1``` will resume the job with job ID 1 and run it in the background.

## fg
- The fg command is used to bring a background job to the foreground. 
- It takes a job ID or job specification as an argument. 
- For example, ```fg %1``` will bring the job with job ID 1 to the foreground.

## nohup
- The nohup command is used to run a command immune to hangups (i.e., it continues running even if the user logs out or the terminal session is terminated). 
- It is often used to run long-running processes in the background. 
- The command is typically used in the following format: ```nohup command &```
- For example, ```nohup python script.py &``` will run the python script.py command in the background and make it immune to hangups.
- It also creates a file "nohup.out" & write all the logs related to that command in it.

## nice
- The nice command is used to execute a command with a specific priority level. 
- It allows you to control the CPU priority of a command. 
- The nice command is followed by a priority level (typically ranging from -20 to 19, where lower values represent higher priorities).
- For example, nice -n 10 command will run the command with a lower priority, allowing other processes with higher priorities to get more CPU time.   
```nice -n 10 command_name```
