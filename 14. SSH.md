## To access SSH using Putty

1. Download and install Putty: Visit the Putty website (https://www.putty.org/) and download the appropriate version for your operating system. Install Putty on your local machine.

2. Launch Putty: Open Putty and you will see a configuration window.

3. Enter the SSH server details: In the configuration window, enter the IP address or hostname of the remote server you want to connect to in the "Host Name" field. Make sure the "SSH" protocol is selected. Specify the port number if it's different from the default SSH port (port 22).

4. Configure SSH settings (optional): You can configure various SSH settings such as encryption, authentication methods, and compression. The default settings are usually sufficient for most cases.

5. Connect to the server: Click the "Open" button to initiate the SSH connection. A terminal window will open, and you will be prompted to enter your username and password to log in to the remote server.

## To access SSH from one Linux server to another

1. Open the terminal on the local Linux server from which you want to connect to the remote server.

2. Use the ssh command: In the terminal, type the following command:
```bash
ssh username@remote_server_ip
```

3. Enter your password: After executing the ssh command, you will be prompted to enter the password for the remote server. Type your password and press Enter.

4. SSH connection established: If the provided username and password are correct, an SSH connection will be established, and you will be logged into the remote server. You can now execute commands, transfer files, or perform other tasks on the remote server.

## Using SSH key

1. Generate SSH key pair: On your local machine, open a terminal and use the following command to generate an SSH key pair:
```bash
ssh-keygen -t rsa
```
This will generate a public key (id_rsa.pub) and a private key (id_rsa) in the ~/.ssh/ directory.

2. Copy the public key to the remote server: Use the following command to copy your public key to the remote server. Replace username with your username on the remote server, and remote_server_ip with the IP address or hostname of the remote server:
```bash
ssh-copy-id username@remote_server_ip
```
You will be prompted to enter your password for the remote server.

3. Test the SSH connection: Try connecting to the remote server using SSH:
```bash
ssh username@remote_server_ip
```
