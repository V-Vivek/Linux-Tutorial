## Port 
- It refers to a communication endpoint that processes can use to establish network connections.

## Socket
- It is an endpoint for sending or receiving data across a network. It is created when a program or process opens a network connection. 

## What is meant by the term Super User?
- The Super User is a user with access to all files and commands within the system. In general, this superuser login is to access root and it is secured with the root password.

## Kernel 
- The kernel is the core component of the Linux operating system. 
- It is responsible for managing system resources, providing hardware abstraction, and enabling communication between software and hardware components. 
- The kernel acts as an interface between the hardware and the user-level software. 
- It handles tasks such as process management, memory management, device management, file system management, and networking. 
- The kernel is loaded into memory when the system boots up and remains in memory throughout the system's operation.

## Shell
- A shell refers to the command-line interface or the user interface through which users interact with the operating system. 
- The shell interprets commands entered by the user and executes them. 
- It provides a way to run programs, navigate the file system, manage processes, and perform various administrative tasks. 

## Swap Memory
- Swap memory, also known as swap space or paging, is a portion of the hard disk that is used by the operating system as virtual memory.
- When the physical RAM becomes full, the operating system moves inactive pages from RAM to the swap space, making room for more active processes in the RAM. 
- This swapping process helps prevent out-of-memory errors and allows the system to continue running even if the available RAM is limited. 

## Unix System Layers

The Unix system is composed of multiple layers, each serving a specific purpose and providing different functionalities. Here is an overview of the layers in the Unix system:

### Hardware Layer

The hardware layer comprises the physical components of a computer system, including the processor, memory, storage devices, input/output devices, and network interfaces. It provides the underlying infrastructure on which the Unix system operates.

### Kernel Layer

The kernel is the core of the Unix system and resides between the hardware layer and the user layer. It provides essential services for managing system resources, handling hardware devices, and facilitating communication between software and hardware. The kernel manages processes, memory allocation, file systems, device drivers, and network protocols.

### Shell Layer

The shell layer is the command-line interface through which users interact with the Unix system. It interprets user commands and executes them. The shell provides features like command history, input/output redirection, piping, scripting, and various built-in utilities. Examples of Unix shells include Bash, sh, csh, and tcsh.

### User Utilities Layer

The user utilities layer consists of various command-line utilities and programs that users can execute within the shell. These utilities perform specific tasks such as file manipulation (ls, cp, mv), text processing (grep, sed, awk), network communication (ssh, telnet), system administration (user management, disk management), and more. These utilities are typically invoked from the shell or used within shell scripts.

### Application Layer

The application layer includes higher-level software applications and services that are built on top of the Unix system. These applications can range from text editors (vi, emacs) and programming languages (C, Python, Java) to database systems, web servers, email clients, and other specialized software. The application layer leverages the underlying layers of the Unix system to provide specific functionalities to end-users.
