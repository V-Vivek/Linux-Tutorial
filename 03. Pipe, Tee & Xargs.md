## Pipe
- Output of first command passed/redirected to second command
### Case 1 : Find no. of files ina directory
```bash
ls | wc -l
```

### Case 2 : Combine file contents from 2 files and sort it
```bash
cat file1 file2 | sort
```

### Case 3 : Find unique records from a file
```bash
cat names | sort | uniq
```

### Case 4 : Output only line 30-37 from a file with 100 lines
```bash

## Tee
- Tee reads standard input and copies it both to stdout and to a file
- We can see the information going through pipeline in the stdout

### Write the file name in a new file & in stdout
```bash
ls | tee filenames.txt
```

## Xargs
- It converts the stdin into command line argument
- e.g. ```bash ls | echo``` this will not output anything in stdout as the echo command accepts input only from stdin
### Using xargs we will convert the output from ls into command line argument acceptable by echo
```bash
ls | xargs echo
```

### Delete files whose name is present in to_delete.txt file
```bash
cat to_delete.txt | xargs rm
```
