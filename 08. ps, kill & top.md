- Simple process status
```bash
ps
```

- To see all process status (hidden)
```bash
ps -e
```
```bash
ps -A
```

- To see all process status for specific user
```bash
ps -u username
```

- To see all process status for specific group
```bash
ps -g groupname
```

# Kill command
- The kill command in Linux is used to send signals to running processes. 
- The signals can be used to control and interact with processes in various ways. 
- Syntax:
```bas
kill [OPTIONS] PID
```
- [OPTIONS] : Signal name or number
- PID : Process ID

## To get the list of different signal types
```bash
kill -l
```

## Options for kill command:
### kill PID
- This command sends the default signal, ***SIGTERM***, to the process with the specified PID. 
- The SIGTERM signal is a termination signal that requests the process to terminate gracefully. 
- The process can catch this signal and perform cleanup operations before exiting.
```bash
kill 1234
```

### kill -15 PID or kill -TERM PID
- This command is similar to the first command (kill PID). 
- -15 or -TERM is optional because SIGTERM is the default signal sent by the kill command when no signal is specified. 
- For example, ```kill -15 1234``` is equivalent to ```kill 1234```

### kill -1 PID or kill -HUP PID
- This command sends the SIGHUP signal (hang-up signal) to the process with the specified PID. 
- The SIGHUP signal is commonly used to instruct a process to reload its configuration or restart. 
- Processes that are designed to handle the SIGHUP signal may gracefully reload their configuration files when they receive it. 
```bash
kill -1 1234
```

### kill -2 PID or kill -INT PID
- This command sends the SIGINT signal (interrupt signal) to the process with the specified PID. 
- The SIGINT signal is typically generated by pressing Ctrl+C in the terminal. 
- It requests the process to terminate gracefully, similar to SIGTERM. 
- Processes can catch the SIGINT signal and perform cleanup operations before exiting. 
```bash
kill -2 1234 
```

### kill -9 PID or kill -KILL PID
- This command sends the SIGKILL signal to the process with the specified PID. 
- The SIGKILL signal is a termination signal that immediately terminates the process without giving it a chance to perform any cleanup tasks. 
- It forcefully terminates the process. 
- This signal should be used as a last resort when a process is unresponsive or cannot be terminated gracefully using other signals. 
```bash
kill -9 1234
```

# top command
- The top command in Linux is a powerful utility used to monitor system processes and resource usage in real-time. 
- When executed, top provides an interactive view that continuously updates and displays information about the system's CPU usage, memory usage, running processes, and other system metrics.  

## Interactive Commands
top provides several interactive commands that allow you to sort and manipulate the displayed information.
- Pressing k allows you to kill a selected process by entering its PID.
- Pressing r prompts you to renice a selected process, allowing you to change its priority. Negative value means high priority
- Pressing 1 displays CPU usage on a per-core basis.
- Pressing m toggles between displaying memory usage in megabytes or kilobytes.
- Pressing q quits the top command and returns you to the terminal.
