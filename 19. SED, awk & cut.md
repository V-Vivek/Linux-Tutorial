# SED command
- SED is a stream editor used for modifying and transforming text files, allowing you to perform tasks like find and replace, insert or delete lines, and more.

## Substitution (s)
- Replace occurrences of a specific pattern with a specified replacement text.
```bash
sed 's/pattern/replacement/' filename
```
- This command replaces the first occurrence of "apple" with "orange" in the file "file.txt".
```bash
sed 's/apple/orange/' file.txt
```

## To save the sed output back to the file
```bash
sed 's/World/Universe/' data.txt > temp.txt && mv temp.txt data.txt
```

## Delete (d)
- Delete lines based on a given condition or pattern.
- This command deletes all lines containing the specified pattern in the file "file.txt".
```bash
sed '/pattern/d' file.txt
```

## Insert (i)
- Insert text before a specified line or pattern.
- This command inserts the text "New line" before each line containing the specified pattern in the file "file.txt".
```bash
sed '/pattern/i\New line' file.txt
```

## Append (a)
- Append text after a specified line or pattern.
- This command appends the text "New line" after each line containing the specified pattern in the file "file.txt".
```bash
sed '/pattern/a\New line' file.txt
```

## Print (p)
- Print lines that match a given condition or pattern.
- This command prints only the lines containing the specified pattern in the file "file.txt".
- The -n option in the sed command is used to suppress automatic printing of lines.
- By combining the -n option with the p command (print), you can selectively print only the lines that meet the specified condition.
```bash
sed -n '/pattern/p' file.txt
```

# awk command
- AWK is a versatile text processing language used for extracting and manipulating data in text files, often used for pattern scanning and processing.

## Printing
- Print specific fields or lines.
- This command prints the first field of each line in the file "file.txt".
```bash
awk '{print $1}' file.txt
```

## Pattern Matching 
- Filter lines based on a specified pattern.
- This command prints the second field of lines that contain the specified pattern in the file "file.txt".
```bash
awk '/pattern/ {print $2}' file.txt
```

## Field Separation
- Define the field separator.
- This command treats comma (,) as the field separator and prints the second field of each line in the CSV file "file.csv".
```bash
awk -F ',' '{print $2}' file.csv
```
```bash
awk -fs ',' '{print $2}' file.csv
```

## Conditionals (if-else)
- Perform actions based on conditions.
- This command compares the first field of each line with 10 and prints "Large" if it's greater and "Small" if it's not.
```bash
awk '{if ($1 > 10) print "Large"; else print "Small"}' file.txt
```

## Calculations
- Perform arithmetic or string operations.
- This command calculates the sum of the first field in the file "file.txt" and prints the total.
```bash
awk '{total += $1} END {print total}' file.txt
```
- This command calculates the sum of first & second field in the file "file.txt" and prints the total.
```bash
awk '{ total = $1 + $2; print "Total:", total }' file.txt
```
- Built-in math function - sqrt()
```bash
awk '{ result = sqrt($1); print "Square Root:", result }' file.txt
```

# CUT command
- The cut command in Linux is used to extract specific sections (fields or columns) from lines of input text. 
- It allows you to specify delimiters and define which fields to extract.

## Field Extraction
- Extract specific fields or columns from input lines.
- This command extracts the first field from each line of the file "file.txt" using the default tab delimiter.
```bash
cut -f1 file.txt
```
- This command extracts the second and fourth fields from each line of the CSV file "file.csv" using a comma (,) as the delimiter.
```bash
cut -f2,4 -d',' file.csv
```

## Character Range
- Extract a specific range of characters from each line.
- This command extracts the first five characters from each line of the file "file.txt".
```bash
cut -c1-5 file.txt
```

## Delimiter Specification 
- Specify a custom delimiter for field extraction.
- This command extracts the third field from each line of the file "file.txt" using a colon (:) as the delimiter.
```bash
cut -f3 -d':' file.txt
```

## Complement 
- Extract all fields except the specified fields.
- This command extracts all fields except the first field from each line of the file "file.txt".
```bash
cut -f1 --complement file.txt
```
