## cron job
- cron job is a scheduled task or command that is automatically executed at specific intervals or at predefined times. 
- It is a time-based job scheduler that runs in the background and can be used to automate repetitive tasks or perform system maintenance.
- To manage cron jobs, the ```crontab``` command is used.
- This command lists the existing cron jobs for the current user. It displays the scheduled commands along with their execution times.  
```crontab -l```  
- This command opens the user's cron table in a text editor, allowing them to create or edit cron jobs. The cron table contains the scheduled commands and their execution times.  
```crontab -e```  

- When you run crontab -e, the cron table is opened in the default text editor specified in the VISUAL or EDITOR environment variable. 
- You can add new cron jobs or modify existing ones by following the cron syntax.

- The cron syntax consists of fields representing different time elements, such as minutes, hours, days, months and days of the week. 
- Each field can contain specific values, ranges, or wildcards to define when the command should be executed.
