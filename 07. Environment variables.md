## Environment Variables
- Environment variables are a set of dynamic values that can affect the behavior of processes and programs running on the system. 
- These variables store information such as system configuration, user preferences, and runtime parameters. 
- They are stored in the shell's environment and can be accessed or modified by processes and programs.

## System vs User Variables: 
- Linux has two types of environment variables:
### System Variables: 
- These are set for the entire system and are usually defined in system-wide configuration files. 
- They affect all users and processes on the system.
### User Variables: 
- These are specific to each user and are typically set in user-specific configuration files like ***.bashrc*** or ***.bash_profile***.
- They only affect the respective user's environment.

## Common Environment Variables
- ***PATH:*** Specifies the directories to search for executable programs.
- ***HOME:*** Indicates the user's home directory.
- ***USER and USERNAME:*** Store the username of the current user.
- ***PWD:*** Holds the current working directory.
- ***SHELL:*** Specifies the default shell for the user.

## Setting and Modifying Environment Variables
### Temporary Setting: 
- You can set an environment variable temporarily in the current session by using the export command followed by the variable assignment.
- Example: ```export VARIABLE_NAME=value```

### Permanent Setting: 
- To set an environment variable permanently, you can add the variable assignment to the user's shell configuration file 
- (e.g., .bashrc, .bash_profile) or system-wide configuration files.
#### To set environment variable permanently for ***non-root*** user
```bash
vi .bashrc
VARIABLE_NAME=value
export VARIABLE_NAME
source .bashrc
```
#### To set environment variable permanently for ***root*** user
- Make sure you are logged in as root
```bash
vi /etc/profile
VARIABLE_NAME=value
export VARIABLE_NAME
source /etc/profile
```
***Note: We use source command to reload/refresh the file***

## Viewing Environment Variables
- Using printenv
```bash
printenv [OPTIONNAL_VARIABLE_NAME]
```
- Using env
```bash
env [OPTIONNAL_VARIABLE_NAME]
```
- Using echo
```bash
echo $VARIABLE_NAME
```
```bash
echo $HOME
```
