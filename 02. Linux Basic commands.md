- Rename file
We don't have separate rename command in Linux, we use 'mv' command to rename a file
```bash
mv old_filename new_filename
```

- Zip & unzip single file
1. The gzip command is used to compress files using the gzip compression algorithm. It creates a compressed file with the extension .gz
```bash
gzip file.txt
```
2. To decompress a gzip file  
```bash
gunzip file.txt.gz
```

- Zip and unzip multiple files  
1. Create a tar archive with multiple files  
***-c*** : It tells the tar command to "create" a new archive  
***-f*** : To specify the file name of the archive that will be created. It is followed by the name of the archive file  
```bash
tar -cf archive.tar file1.txt file2.txt directory/
```
2. Compress the tar archive using gzip  
```bash
gzip archive.tar
```
3. Decompress the gzip file  
```bash
gunzip archive.tar.gz
```
4. Extract the files from the archive(tar)  
```bash
tar xf archive.tar
```

- Split command
To split file into multiple files after every 10 lines
```bash
split -l 10 input_filename output_file_prefix
```

- Combine multiple files
```bash
cat file1 file2 file3 > newfile
```

- grep command  
It is used to search for text patterns within files or the output of other commands. It stands for "Global Regular Expression Print".  
1. Search in single file  
```bash
grep "pattern" myfile.txt
```
2. Serach in a directory & it's sub-directories recursively  
```bash
grep -r "pattern" mydir/
```
3. Serach from other commands output
```bash
cat file1.txt | grep "pattern"
```

- Sort command  
Note that this doesn't update the file contents, it just prints the contents in sorted manner  
1. Sorting lines alphabetically  
```bash
sort myfile.txt
```
2. Sorting lines numerically  
```bash
sort -n numbers.txt
```
3. Sorting lines in reverse order  
```bash
sort -r myfile.txt
```
